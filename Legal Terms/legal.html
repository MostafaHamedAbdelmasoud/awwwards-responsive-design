You can opt to upgrade or downgrade your service agreement to any other contract agreement that Awwwards is currently offering for sale at any time during your contract term. In the event of a contract downgrade, a discount credit will be issued to your Awwwards account for the difference in the cost of the two contracts over the remainder of your original contract term. This credit can be applied to future months of service with Awwwards, and is in no way transferable to a cash refund.

                            <p>d. At the end of the contract term, your contract will automatically renew for an additional contract term until explicitly cancelled by you. Cancellation must be issued via your user panel or via Awwwards customer support. Any cancellation issued via your user panel must be completed at least one (1) working day prior to the end of the contract term. Any cancellation carried out via Awwwards customer support must be carried out at least three (3) working days prior to the end of the contract term to allow for adequate processing time.
